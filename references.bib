We outline the merits of and differences between the various quantities used for parameterizing noise curves and characterizing gravitational-wave amplitudes. We conclude by producing plots that consistently compare different detectors. Similar figures can be generated on-line for general use at $\backslash$url{\{}http://rhcole.com/apps/GWplotter{\}}.},

    abstract = {We propose a graphical representation of detector sensitivity curves for stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds that takes into account the increase in sensitivity that comes from integrating over frequency in addition to integrating over time. This method is valid for backgrounds that have a power-law spectrum in the analysis band. We call these graphs "power-law integrated curves." For simplicity, we consider cross-correlation searches for unpolarized and isotropic stochastic backgrounds using two or more detectors. We apply our method to construct power-law integrated sensitivity curves for second-generation ground-based detectors such as Advanced LIGO, space-based detectors such as LISA and the Big Bang Observer, and timing residuals from a pulsar timing array. The code used to produce these plots is available at https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1300115/public for researchers interested in constructing similar sensitivity curves.},

These calculations are performed in both a Bayesian and frequentist framework, using both analytical and numerical methods. These calculations are used to clarify the interpretation of the sensitivity curves and to illustrate the sometimes overlooked fact that the sensitivity curve depends not only on the properties of the pulse time-of-arrival data set but also on the properties of the source being observed. The Bayesian and frequentist frameworks were found to give consistent results and the analytic and numerical calculations were also found to be in good agreement.},

@article{Jaffe2003,
    abstract = {We calculate the expected nHz-$\mu$Hz gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from coalescing massive black hole (MBH) binaries resulting from mergers of their host galaxies. We consider detection of this spectrum by precision pulsar timing and a future pulsar timing array. The spectrum depends on the merger rate of massive galaxies, the demographics of MBHs at low and high redshift, and the dynamics of MBH binaries. We apply recent theoretical and observational work on all of these fronts. The spectrum has a characteristic strain hc(f) {\~{}} 10-15(f/yr-1)-2/3, just below the detection limit from recent analysis of precision pulsar timing measurements. However, the amplitude of the spectrum is still very uncertain owing to approximations in the theoretical formulation of the model, to our lack of knowledge of the merger rate and MBH population at high redshift, and to the dynamical problem of removing enough angular momentum from the MBH binary to reach a GW-dominated regime.},

  abstract={Supermassive black holes can capture or disrupt stars that come sufficiently close. This paper reviews the dynamical processes by which stars or stellar remnants are placed onto loss-cone orbits and the implications for feeding rates. The capture rate is well defined for spherical galaxies with nuclear relaxation times that are shorter than the galaxy's age. However, even the dense nucleus of the Milky Way may be less than one relaxation time old, and this is certainly the case for more massive galaxies; the capture rate in such galaxies is an initial-value problem with poorly-known initial conditions and the rate can be much higher, or much lower, than the rate in a collisionally-relaxed nucleus. In nonspherical (axisymmetric, triaxial) galaxies, torquing of orbits by the mean field can dominate perturbations due to random encounters, leading to much higher capture rates than in the spherical geometry, particularly in (massive) galaxies with long central relaxation times. Relativistic precession plays a crucial role in mediating the capture of compact remnants from regions very near to the black hole, by destroying the orbital correlations that would otherwise dominate the torques. The complex dynamics of relativistic loss cones are not yet well enough understood for accurate estimates of compact-object (‘EMRI’) capture rates to be made.}

            SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.

Monte Carlo methods are used to verify the usefulness of this formula for small samples. A data-based procedure for choosing the bin width parameter is proposed, which assumes a Gaussian reference standard and requires only the sample size and an estimate of the standard deviation. The sensitivity of the procedure is investigated using several probability models which violate the Gaussian assumption.}",
